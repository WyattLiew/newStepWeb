					<p>The impact of COVID-19 has disrupted daily life as we know it and caused a shift in technology trends within the workplace. Over recent weeks, businesses have found themselves hastily searching for and implementing temporary solutions to help them deliver an uninterrupted service. These solutions are highlighting the significant role technology plays in helping companies adapt to the situation and maintain daily operations. But what happens once the crisis is over?</p>
					<h2>The Importance of Adopting Technology Now</h2>
					<p>Following the advice of health experts, many AEC businesses have had to close their offices and switch to remote work in order to prevent the further spread of the virus. Companies who had never even entertained the idea of remote work are now seeing their entire workforce working from home.</p>
					<p>The switch to remote working is forcing the industry to evaluate their position when it comes to digitalization as companies need to think of alternative ways to conduct business. This likely includes implementing new technology to set up processes and enable remote collaboration. The sooner companies become familiar with this new technology, the quicker it will be for teams to adapt to their new situation. This can once again provide routine and structure and enable as close an approximation to workplace normality as possible.</p>
					<h2>How the Workplace of the Future Could Look</h2>
					<p>While no one can truly predict what’s in store post-COVID-19, it would be difficult for working life to go back to exactly the way it was. Based on the things that are happening now, some workplace changes that may stick around post-pandemic include: An Increase in Remote Work</p>
					<p>Before the pandemic, remote work wasn’t really embraced by the architecture industry, compared to other professions. However, now that employees are proving it to be a feasible option, that may mean that it could be offered in more workplaces in the future.</p>

					<h2>A Rise in Click & Mortar Businesses</h2>
					<p>With the quarantine measures ordered by governments around the world, many brick and mortar businesses are suffering. Those that can have adopted a “click and mortar” model as an alternative. Click and mortar refers to a business model that incorporates online operations alongside its offline. This strategy emphasizes the need to adapt to changing times and could be something that remains for many businesses even once the pandemic is over.</p>
					<h2>More Touchless Technology</h2>
					<p>COVID-19 has many people washing their hands like they’ve never washed them before. This health crisis has made people more conscious of better hygiene practices and has influenced how cautiously they navigate the world outside of their homes. A post-pandemic future within the workplace could see more touchless technology implemented in studios, office buildings, and showrooms. Lights, elevator buttons, and washroom taps are just some examples of where sensor technology could be put in place to help curb the spread of bacteria.</p>
